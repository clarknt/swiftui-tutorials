## Adjustments
- Correct animation issue on graph title
- Replace double "Done" button by "Cancel" and "Done" buttons and correct behaviour

## Issues
- Graph arrow button is black instead of blue (changes to blue if List is replaced by ScrollView + VStack)
- Graph bottom links are not clickable (work if List is replaced by ScrollView + VStack)
